I'm hoping you can check my code with these, becuase I couldn't use these commands to make it run: 
`./binexp_parser.py` or `python3 binexp_parser.py`

;;> Yep, it ran!

;;> Tests are very sparse and miss some obvious bugs. Overall well done though!

1. I was only able to complete the 2 required sub tasks, plus the one that multiplies by zero. 

2. This was my first time using binary trees and accessing files within files on Python. In doing this I got more used to tracking what I'm doing with all the variables required to do the tree computation, as well as collapsing the tree. 

3. Finding any bug in this assignment was a challenge, as there seem to be too many moving parts to this clock. I wish I had been more familiar with python before doing this so I wouldn't have had to rely on outside resources to teach me how to do a particular thing with the code.
